# A Collection of Random Scripts

These are some scripts that were scrapped together that may or not be useful in the future.
### Finance Alg
This script is to determine if a request for money can be granted for a specific team in an unbiased way. Right now, it contains fake data. This algorithm is still being fine tuned.
to run:
' $ python financeAlg.py <team name in all lowercase no spaces> <amount you want to request> <priority level> '
Priority levels:
  
  Priority 1 (will the project not be able to function without it?):
AWS, Twilio, etc
 Domain Name

Priority 2:
User Research
Marketing (flyers, posters, stickers, diddy riese, etc)

Priority 3:
Workflow technologies (slack, jira, etc)
Events (booking rooms, alc for ragers)
